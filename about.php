				Content management (CM) is a set of processes and technologies that supports the collection, managing, and publishing of information in any form or medium. When stored and accessed via computers, this information may be more specifically referred to as digital content, or simply as content.

				Digital content may take the form of text (such as electronic documents), multimedia files (such as audio or video files), or any other file type that follows a content lifecycle requiring management.	<img src="images/17.jpg" height="300px" width="400px">
				
				The process is complex enough to manage that several large and small commercial software vendors such as Interwoven and Microsoft offer content management software to control and automate significant aspects of the content lifecycle.
				CMS A content management system (CMS)[1][2][3] is a computer application that supports the creation and modification of digital content. It typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environment.[4]

CMS features vary widely. Most CMSs include Web-based publishing, format management, history editing and version control, indexing, search, and retrieval. By their nature, content management systems support the separation of content and preparation.

A web content management system (WCM or WCMS) is a CMS designed to support the management of the content of Web pages. Most popular CMSs are also WCMSs. Web content includes text and embedded graphics, photos, video, audio, maps, and program code (e.g., for applications) that displays content or interacts with the user.

Such a content management system (CMS) typically has two major components:

    A content management application (CMA) is the front-end user interface that allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify, and remove content from a website without the intervention of a webmaster.
    A content delivery application (CDA) compiles that information and updates the website.

Digital asset management systems are another type of CMS. They manage content with clearly defined author or ownership, such as documents, movies, pictures, phone numbers, and scientific data. Companies also use CMSs to store, control, revise, and publish documentation.

Based on market share statistics, the most popular content management system is WordPress, used by over 28% of all websites on the internet, and by 59% of all websites using a known content management system.[5][better source needed] Other popular content management systems include Joomla and Drupal.

				Content management is an inherently collaborative process. It often consists of the following basic roles and responsibilities:
				<ol>
					<li>Creator &minus; responsible for creating and editing content.</li><br>
					
					<li>Editor &minus; responsible for tuning the content message and the style of delivery, including translation and localization.</li><br>
					<li>Publisher &minus; responsible for releasing the content for use.</li>
					<li>Administrator &minus; responsible for managing access permissions to 
					folders and files, usually accomplished by assigning access rights to user groups or roles.<br> Admins may also assist and support users in various ways.</li>
					<li>Consumer, viewer or guest &minus; the person who reads or otherwise takes in content after it is published or shared.</li>
